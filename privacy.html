<br>
<p>Discretion is our guiding principle here in yoursalonexpress.com. We know that you care about how your personal information is used, and we take your concern very seriously. This page explains the steps we've taken to protect your privacy. </p>

<br><b>What Information We Collect</b>
<p>We collect information in order to provide you with a safe, smooth, and customized experience. In general, we collect two types of information: personal information that you provide to help us tailor our services and features to your needs, and anonymous information from visitors to our site that allows us to better understand and serve our community. We do not collect or process information for any other purpose. </p>

<br><b>Information We Collect from Visitors</b>
<p>Log Files: Like many websites, we automatically gather information about site traffic (such as Internet Protocol addresses) and store it in log files. We use this information to analyze trends, track movement around the site, and gather demographic data. With this information, we can make the best personal recommendations possible to enhance your customized experience. </p>
<p>Cookies: A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer to make your visits more efficient. We use both session cookies to help you navigate the site and persistent cookies to make return visits easier (for example, by remembering your password). You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions in your internet browser's "help" file. </p>
<p>Clear gifs: We use clear gifs, tiny embedded graphics similar in function to cookies, to help track the effectiveness of our content and communication (for example, by letting us know which emails you have opened). You may choose to opt out of emails containing clear gifs. </p>

<br><b>Information You Provide</b>
<p>Registration or Queries: During registration or asking some questions, we collect contact information so we can communicate with you about the services you wish to use. </p>
<p>User profile: In order to make your online experience both personal and rewarding, we collect background information about you and your skin. You also have the option of providing additional information about your lifestyle, health, and product preferences if you desire more precise product recommendations. </p>
<p>Surveys and contests: If you choose to participate in a survey or contest, we may request contact and demographic information. If a third party is hosting the survey or contest, we will not share your personal information without your express permission. </p>
<p>Invite-A-Friend, Email this Product to a Friend: You may choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site. If so, we will request your friend's name and email address. </p>
<p>Public spaces: Please be aware that any information you choose to post on forums, blogs, or product reviews is public, and others can access and collect this information. We encourage you to exercise discretion. </p>

<br><b>Protecting Your Information</b>
<p>If your personal information changes, or if you no longer wish to use our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your information by changing your user profile or by emailing our Customer Support at support@ yoursalonexpress.com . You can unsubscribe from our email newsletters by updating the preferences in your user profile or by following the instructions at the end of the email. </p>
We follow and often surpass accepted industry standards (for example, encryption of sensitive information) to protect your personal information, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission or storage is entirely secure, however, and we cannot guarantee complete security of information. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can email us at support@yoursalonexpress.com . </p>

<br><b>How We Use Your Information</b>
<p>We collect information about your skin, physical characteristics, and skincare concerns and preferences in order to match you with people who are just like you. This enables us to identify the products and services that will work best for you. </p>
<p>We do not rent or sell your personal information, including your contact information, to anyone, and we will only share it under the following circumstances: </p>
<p> replenishyouthnow.com staff: yoursalonexpress.com staff and authorized consultants may have access to your personal information as part of their normal duties. </p>
<p>Compliance with the law: We may disclose your personal information when required by law or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the legal rights of yoursalonexpress.com or its employees. </p>
<p>Authorized service providers: We may share your personal information with certain authorized service providers we engage to perform specific services intended to enhance your online experience. These service providers are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose. </p>
<p>Advertising partners: The ads appearing on our website are delivered by our advertising partners, who may use cookies and clear gifs to help target their ads more effectively. We may share website usage information with our partners, but not personal information that would allow them to identify you. </p>
<p>Aggregated and non-personal information: We may use any non-personal information we collect on the site for general business analysis and to develop content and new services that may be of interest to you. </p>
<p>Others: We will inform you before your personal information is collected by anyone who is not an authorized service provider or advertising partner so you can make an informed choice as to whether you wish to share this information. We will never provide your email address to a third party without your express permission. </p>

<br><b>Changes to this Policy</b>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page and elsewhere so you can stay informed about what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it. We may change our privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.
